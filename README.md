# Text_Classification
Project Description : This project consists of two Datasets - mini_newsgroups and 20_newsgroups. Both the datasets consists of 20 different news groups and we need to predict that the given test file belongs to which category of news group. I have implemented this using the inbuilt Multinomial Naive Bayes(in sklearn) as well as I have made my own Naive Bayes Classifier from scratch without using inbuilt library.
